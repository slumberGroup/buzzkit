# Authenticating with BuzzKit

BuzzKit authenticates every API request with a bearer API key. There is no OAuth flow today: keys are created in the dashboard, shown once, and sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>` on every call to `https://api.buzzkit.dev/v1` or to a self-hosted deployment.

## Discover

BuzzKit publishes no OAuth metadata: there is no `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`, no `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`, no `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata` challenge and no `agent_auth` identity, claim or events endpoints. Agents do not register themselves or exchange assertions; a person creates a key once and the agent uses it. What exists:

- OpenAPI description: https://buzzkit.dev/openapi.json (the `bearerAuth` security scheme applies to every operation except `/v1/health`)
- API catalog: https://buzzkit.dev/.well-known/api-catalog
- Documentation: https://docs.buzzkit.dev
- Error envelope: every response, including errors, is `{ "success", "data", "error", "metadata" }`

## Pick a method

| Key | Prefix | Where it runs | What it can reach |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Workspace key | `bk_ws_` | Your backend | Every tenant of the workspace; pick one per request with the `buzzkit-tenant: <slug>` header, or omit it for the default tenant |
| Tenant key | `bk_tn_` | A backend that should only see one tenant | That tenant's data plane only |
| Client key | `bk_pk_` | Inside the app binary | `/v1/client/*` only: identify, device registration, the subscriber's own preferences |

A backend integration needs one workspace key. Use a tenant key when a customer or a semi-trusted subsystem should get direct access with a one-tenant blast radius. Ship a client key in the app; it cannot read other subscribers or send.

## Register

1. Create an account at https://buzzkit.dev/signup (email and password). Every account starts a workspace with a default tenant.
2. Upload the APNs key or the Firebase service account for that tenant so push is connected.

Sign-up is self-serve, there is no approval step, and the free plan needs no card.

## Claim

Keys are created in the dashboard under your workspace's API keys page (`https://buzzkit.dev/<workspace>/keys`) by a signed-in member with the `keys:write` scope. Choose the kind (workspace, tenant or client), the tenant for tenant and client keys, the scopes, and an optional expiry. The secret is shown exactly once; BuzzKit stores only its SHA-256 hash.

Keys cannot mint keys: `keys:*`, `invites:*`, `members:write`, `workspace:delete` and `tenants:secrets` are session-only, so a leaked key can never escalate.

## Exchange

There is nothing to exchange. The key is the bearer token and stays valid until it expires or is revoked.

## Use the access_token

```
curl https://api.buzzkit.dev/v1/messages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer bk_ws_..." \
  -H "buzzkit-tenant: gymly" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "to": "user_42", "title": "Leg day", "body": "6:00 with Maya." }'
```

Scopes are `resource:action` pairs (`messages:write`, `subscribers:read`, `events:write`, `topics:*`, `*`). Every route declares exactly one required scope; a key without it gets a 403 with the code `missing_permission`.

## Errors

| Status | Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 401 | `missing_authorization` | No `Authorization` header |
| 401 | `invalid_api_key` | Unknown, revoked or malformed key; a key presented under the wrong prefix is also invalid |
| 401 | `api_key_expired` | The key's expiry has passed |
| 403 | `forbidden` | The key belongs to another workspace or tenant, or is the wrong kind for the route |
| 403 | `missing_permission` | The key lacks the route's scope |
| 404 | `not_found` | The addressed workspace or tenant does not exist for this credential |

Errors look like `{ "success": false, "data": null, "error": { "code": "invalid_api_key", "message": "Invalid API key", "param": null, "details": null }, "metadata": { "timestamp": "...", "requestId": "..." } }`. Quote `metadata.requestId` in support requests.

## Revocation and rotation

Revoke a key from the dashboard's API keys page or with `DELETE /v1/workspaces/<workspace>/keys/<id>` as a signed-in member. Rotate a leaked key in place with `POST /v1/workspaces/<workspace>/keys/<id>/rotate`: the key keeps its id, name and scopes, the old secret dies at once and the new secret is returned exactly once. Both take effect immediately in the region that served the request and within about a minute everywhere else. For a zero-downtime swap, create the replacement first, move your backend over, then revoke the old key.
