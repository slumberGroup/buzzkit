# Design system

The source of truth for everything visual in buzzkit. If you are building UI — a route, a component, a one-off panel — read the rules here first and reach for the tokens and components below before writing anything custom.

- **Package:** `packages/ui` → `@buzzkit/ui`
- **Tokens:** `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css` (the only file that may contain a raw color)
- **Live reference:** `/ui` in `apps/web` — every component, every state, rendered in both themes. Anything you add belongs there.
- **This file, served:** `/design.md`

Built on **shadcn (Base UI style, `base-nova`)** + **Tailwind v4**. Components are ours to edit; add new ones with `bunx shadcn add <name>` inside `packages/ui`, then restyle to tokens.

**Visual identity:** soft, playful, clean, few colors used deliberately. Open Runde as the typeface, a black primary so color is reserved for meaning, superellipse corners, hairline shadows instead of borders, and a press that moves the background but never the label.

---

## 1. The rules that never bend

1. **Never hardcode a color.** No hex, no `rgb()`, no `rgba()`, no raw Tailwind palette (`bg-zinc-100`) in a component. Use a token utility (`bg-bg-2`, `text-fg-3`, `shadow-control`). `globals.css` is the only place a literal color exists. The one exemption is **user data colors** — hex values stored through the API (status and label colors, and the swatch presets offered for picking them) render via inline `style`, since they are content, not chrome.
2. **All colors are OKLCH.** Perceptually uniform lightness, stable hue across a ramp. Never add a hex.
3. **The brand is only ever `primary-*`.** Components reference the alias ramp, never a concrete hue. Re-pointing `--primary-*` re-brands the product.
4. **Icons are Central Icons only**, via `<Icon name='Icon…' />`. Never lucide, never an inline `<svg>`.
5. **Only the background scales on press.** The label never moves. See §7.
6. **Tailwind only emits classes it can see as literal strings.** `` `bg-${ramp}-1` `` produces nothing. Use lookup tables of complete class names.
7. **Every state has a static cue.** Motion is enhancement; it is removed entirely under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
8. **Never let `hover:` be the only feedback.** Pair it with the same value on `active:` — see §7.1. A hover-only affordance is completely invisible on touch.
9. **A title and its description sit `gap-0.5` (2px) apart**, everywhere: card headers, page headers, row title over subtitle, step title over description. Never `gap-px`, never more. (This is the one place buzzkit departs from feedbase, which runs them flush.)

## 2. Color

Light lives in `:root`, dark in `.dark` on `<html>`. Tokens flip automatically — components use tokens plus `dark:` variants, never theme-conditional JS.

### 2.1 Neutrals — the whole UI

Two ladders. Surfaces recede as the number climbs; foregrounds strengthen.

| Token | Role | Use for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bg-1` | page / card | The default surface |
| `bg-2` | recessed | Inputs, segmented tracks, kbd, code blocks |
| `bg-3` | more recessed | **The border color** — every separator, divider and structural border, plus the dark-mode shadow rings and unchecked control tracks |
| `bg-4` | most recessed | Disabled fills, focus rings, avatar fallbacks, skeletons, the read-only input border |
| `fg-1` | **decorative only** | Dividers, watermarks, disabled glyphs. **Never text, labels or placeholders** — it measures ~2.1:1 |
| `fg-2` | secondary text | Descriptions, captions, placeholders, inactive tabs, menu shortcuts |
| `fg-3` | body text | The inherited default on `<body>` |
| `fg-4` | strong text | Titles, headings, active states |

Measured contrast (WCAG 2):

| Pair | Light | Dark |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fg-2` on `bg-1` | 5.01 | 5.75 |
| `fg-2` on `bg-2` | 4.64 | 5.36 |
| `fg-3` on `bg-1` | 7.67 | 9.33 |
| `fg-4` on `bg-1` | 17.74 | 15.59 |

**Alpha neutrals** (`bg-a1`…`bg-a4`, `fg-a1`…`fg-a4`) are translucent — they tint what is underneath instead of covering it. Use them for hover fills and borders on a surface whose color you do not know.

Two more neutral aliases exist for page chrome: `background` (the page) and `background-subtle` (page background when cards need to read as elevated).

### 2.2 Accent ramps

Nine hues: `purple`, `sky`, `blue`, `green`, `amber`, `orange`, `red`, `pink`, `yellow`.

| Step | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `-1` | Tint background (chips, subtle callouts) |
| `-2` | Stronger tint, hover on a tint |
| `-3` | Mid — borders, decorative fills |
| `-4` | **Solid fill** — the saturated one |
| `-text` | **Text on the matching `-1` tint** — the only step safe to read as type on a tint |
| `-a1`…`-a4` | Alpha variants of `-4` |

**`-4` is a fill, `-text` is a text color.** Reading `-4` as text on its own `-1` tint lands at 1.7:1–2.4:1 — unreadable. In light mode `-text` keeps its ramp's hue and rides maximum chroma while dropping lightness until it clears **APCA Lc 60**, the threshold for non-body text like chips (measured Lc 60–61, WCAG 3.4–3.9 — deliberate; the WCAG-4.5 alternative turns amber and orange into mud). In dark mode `-4` already clears 4.5:1 on its own tint, so `-text` aliases it and the tuned dark palette is untouched.

```tsx
<Badge variant='amber'>Pending</Badge>   // bg-amber-1 + text-amber-text
```

**Purple is for tags, labels and badges only** (tenant keys, Android, a message that is currently sending). Never accent chrome with it.

### 2.3 Primary — the brand alias

`--primary-1`…`--primary-4` and `--primary-a1`…`--primary-a4` are **aliases**, currently pointed at the neutrals — which is what makes the brand black. Solid buttons, checked controls and focus rings all read through them. To re-brand, re-point that one block:

```css
--primary-4: var(--sky-4);   /* the whole product follows */
```

Beside the alias sits one real hue: **`brand-1`…`brand-4`, `brand-deep`, `brand-text`**, the logo's violet, defined once in `globals.css` for both themes (dark rebuilds it on the accent ramps' dark recipe, `-text` aliasing the fill like every other ramp). It is decorative only: it tints signed-out surfaces (the marketing hero panel, the auth pages) and never carries state, chrome or an action. Nothing inside the signed-in dashboard references it.

### 2.4 Semantic (shadcn) mapping

`--background`, `--foreground`, `--card`, `--popover`, `--muted`, `--accent`, `--destructive`, `--border`, `--input`, `--ring` all resolve to the tokens above. They exist so shadcn components drop in unmodified. Prefer the direct tokens (`bg-bg-2`) in our own code — they say more. `--border` points at `bg-3` and a base rule paints every bare `border` utility with it, so unqualified borders land on the one border color automatically.

### 2.5 Selection follows the surface

`::selection` reads the inherited **`--selection`** variable (default `--bg-a4`, the neutral surface tint: dark on light surfaces, light on dark), so text selection adapts to whatever surface it sits on. A tinted surface re-colors selection for its whole subtree with one utility — `selection-inverse` on dark/primary surfaces (primary bubbles, solid badges, the primary pill), `selection-amber` on internal-message surfaces, `selection-<hue>` on each badge tint. Backgrounds are translucent alpha steps (`-a3`), so the original text color stays readable and no per-surface text color is needed. When you build a new tinted surface, set its selection utility in the same commit.

### 2.6 Contrast floors

- Body text: WCAG 4.5:1 / APCA Lc 75
- Non-body (chips, badges, captions): APCA Lc 60
- Disabled text is exempt
- Verify **both** themes. Dark is not a mechanical inversion — it is tuned separately.

## 3. Typography

**Open Runde**, self-hosted `.woff2`, four weights. `font-medium` (500) is effectively the only UI weight — hierarchy comes from the `fg` ramp and size, not from weight.

| Class | Size | Leading | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `text-xs` | **13px** | 1.2 | Captions, badges, shortcuts, `xs`/`sm` buttons |
| `text-sm` | 14px | 1.25 | The UI default: buttons, inputs, menus, descriptions |
| `text-base` | 16px | 1.35 | Body copy, card titles |
| `text-xl` | 20px | `leading-tighter` | Dialog titles |
| `text-2xl` | 24px | `leading-tighter` | Page titles |

Default leading is deliberately tighter than the stock Tailwind ratios (1.43/1.5), which read airy in a dense dashboard — wrapped descriptions keep a normal line gap instead of drifting apart.

Rules:

- **One typeface, never a monospace.** Ids, keys, code snippets, URLs, scopes and file names all set in Open Runde like everything else; there is no `--font-mono` token and `font-mono` is never used. Hierarchy and "this is a value" come from the `fg` ramp and `tabular-nums`, not from a second face.
- **Nothing is styled uppercase.** No eyebrow labels, no uppercase table headers, no letter-spaced small caps, no `uppercase` on microcopy — the quiet label is `text-xs` `fg-2` in sentence case, and that is the whole treatment. Capitalization belongs to content (an Apple Team ID's value, the initials inside an avatar fallback), never to style.
- **No off-scale sizes.** There is no `text-[11px]` anywhere; if you need a step, add it to `@theme`.
- **Inputs are `text-sm` at every width.** iOS Safari auto-zooms the page when a focused field is under 16px, and the usual answer is to bump inputs to 16px on mobile. We do the opposite: the field keeps the size it should be, and `maximum-scale=1` in the viewport meta (`apps/web/app/root.tsx`, `apps/widget/index.html`) stops the zoom. Every new HTML entry point needs that meta tag.
- **Textareas render at normal weight, inputs at `font-medium`.** A textarea holds prose that becomes a message, and text must not change weight the moment it is sent; a single-line input holds a short value and reads as data.
- `leading-tighter` (1.15) on anything that can wrap to two lines. Never `leading-none` on wrapping text — descenders collide.
- `text-balance` on titles, `text-pretty` on descriptions. **Never hand-break a sentence.** A dialog description is one string of full sentences and lets `text-pretty` find the line breaks; a `<span className='block'>` or a `<br>` to force "This cannot be undone." onto its own line reads as a ragged orphan at every other width.
- `tracking-tight` on large headings only; base tracking is already slightly tight (`-0.0175em`).
- Cap long-form measure around 60–75 characters.
- `tabular-nums` on any number that changes.
- Body text keeps `cursor: text`; chrome keeps the arrow (handled in `globals.css`).

---

## 4. Shape

Native `corner-shape: superellipse(1.125)` via `corner-superellipse/1.125`, applied to the element **and** its `::before`/`::after` so press layers keep the same corner. Degrades to a plain radius where unsupported.

| Radius | Where |
| --- | --- |
| `rounded-[10px]` | `xs` / `sm` buttons |
| `rounded-xl` (12px) | **The default control radius** — buttons, inputs, selects, popovers, tooltips |
| `rounded-2xl` (16px) | Cards |
| `rounded-3xl` (24px) | Dialogs, sheets, toasts |
| `rounded-full` | Badges, avatars, switches, radios, scrollbar thumbs |

**Nested radii are concentric:** `outer = inner + padding`. TabsList is `rounded-xl` with `p-[3px]` and a `rounded-[9px]` indicator; menu popups are `rounded-xl` with `p-1` and `rounded-lg` items.

Rectangles with clean corners — never pill-shaped buttons.

---

## 5. Elevation

| Token | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `shadow-1` / `shadow-xs` | Barely-there lift |
| `shadow-2` / `shadow-sm` | Cards, tooltips |
| `shadow-3` / `shadow-md` | Popovers, menus, dialogs, toasts |
| `shadow-4` / `shadow-lg` | Sheets |
| `shadow-control` | Solid button fill (drop shadow + inner top highlight) |
| `shadow-control-destructive` | Destructive button fill |
| `shadow-control-elevated` / `-hover` | Elevated button — **flips recipe in dark mode** (drop shadow → inner hairline), so never add a `dark:` variant |
| `shadow-control-knob` | Switch knob |
| `shadow-control-dot` | Radio dot |

**Elevation never responds to hover.** A card, tile or row that reacts to the pointer does it with a background tint (`bg-a1`/`bg-a2`) or a foreground lift, never by growing a shadow — shadow states are fixed per component.

Every shadow ends in a hairline ring — that ring **is** the border. In light mode it is a dark outer ring; in dark mode the recipes flip it inward (a dark ring is invisible on a dark page): surface shadows (`shadow-1`…`4`) switch to an inset `bg-3` ring, the same single border color as every separator and divider, while the elevated control keeps its inner hairline of light. Never add a `dark:` variant to compensate — the tokens flip themselves. Use a real `border` only for structure (the `CardFooter` divider, row dividers, the chat header), always `bg-3`, never to fake elevation; the read-only input's `bg-4` border is the one deliberate exception.

---

## 6. Motion

| Interaction | Duration | Easing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Press / hover / color | 150ms | `ease-out` |
| Nav tab color + icon fades | 200ms | `ease-out` |
| Overlay enter/exit, switch track | 200ms | `ease-out` |
| Sliding indicators | 180ms | `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` |

- **Never `transition-all`.** Always name the properties: `transition-[color,background-color,box-shadow]`.
- CSS transitions for state; keyframes only for one-shot sequences.
- `will-change` only on `transform` / `opacity` / `filter`, and only where you saw stutter.

### Springs

JS animation is `motion/react` (Motion, formerly Framer Motion) only, for anything CSS transitions cannot express. Two specialised pieces sit beside it and are the required answer for their cases: **numbers that change animate with NumberFlow** (`@buzzkit/ui/components/number-flow`, the library wrapped with the one 400ms `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` timing for slide, spin and fade; never the raw `@number-flow/react`; always inside `tabular-nums`, and always `leading-none` with the row sized around it: NumberFlow's SSR markup ships an unlayered `line-height: 1` that beats any layered `leading-*` utility until hydration, so any other leading grows the number on the second paint and shifts the layout), and **short text that changes in place swaps with `TextSwap`** (`@buzzkit/ui/components/text-swap`): a button label that flips from `Next` to `Connect Apple`, a status word. It moves like a slot machine reel with memory: labels are remembered in the order they first appeared, moving to a later one rolls forward (new drops in from the top, old leaves through the bottom) and moving back to an earlier one rolls backward (new rises from the bottom, old leaves through the top), so `Next` returns from where it went (0.4s bounce-0 spring with a 3px blur resolving on the same curve, opacity on a 0.25s ease-out), and the box springs to the new text's width on the same curve so the button grows or shrinks smoothly (the width is a plain pixel number on a `content-box`, never a `calc()` string, and the first measured width is latched into `style` so Motion holds a real starting value: with `initial={false}` it skips writing a mount value that equals the natural width, and the first swap then had nothing to animate from and snapped). Overflow is solved the way NumberFlow solves it, not by clipping: the box carries a `0.5em` × `0.3em` padding zone, pulled back with negative margins so layout is unchanged, under a gradient mask that is fully opaque over the text at rest and fades to nothing across the zone, so while the width is still catching up, whatever pokes past the text area dissolves into the edge instead of being hard-cut or spilling into the button's padding. Letter-morphing libraries are out (they segment by word and degrade to a cross-fade the moment two labels share no word). Never hand-roll a digit roll or a text cross-fade, and never use a letter-morphing library for labels (they segment by word and degrade to a cross-fade the moment two labels share no word). Springs are `{ type: 'spring', duration: 0.3–0.5, bounce: 0 }` — **bounce is always 0**. `AnimatePresence initial={false}` everywhere, so nothing animates on page load. Layout-size moves (the inbox panel slide) run the 0.5 spring; small state swaps run 0.3.

### Icon size

**18px is the icon size.** An icon sitting in a button or inline with text is `size-4.5`; `Button` applies it to any svg child without an explicit size class, so callers never set it. Larger tiles (`IconTile`, 20px) and smaller marks are the deliberate exceptions, never a default.

### Toast copy

A toast title is one line, always: a short statement of what happened ("Email or password is incorrect", "Credential connected"). Anything that would push it to a second line, and any instruction ("Double-check your details or create an account."), goes into the `description`. Toasts are top-centered with a 16px offset (feedbase sat lower only because of its header). A toast is not clickable and shows `cursor-default`; only its action, cancel and close buttons get the pointer.

### Brand marks

Brand marks are icons like any other: `<Icon name='IconGithub' />` comes from Central, and marks Central does not carry (`IconResend`, and our own logo as `IconBuzzkit`) live in `packages/ui/src/components/icon/custom.ts`, drawn into the same 24×24 box and emitted into `paths.ts` by the generator when referenced. No separate brand components, no inline SVGs. On a sign-in button the mark runs at `opacity-100`; inside an `IconTile` it takes the tile's treatment. The sign-in button always reads "Continue with GitHub", whichever page it is on.

### Auth pages

`/login`, `/signup` and `/invite/:token` are the onboarding card without the progress lines (workspace creation at `/onboarding` is the onboarding card itself, step 1 active): a `max-w-md` `Card` centered on the page, title and one-line description in the header, the form in the content, and the alternate action ("Already have an account? Sign in") as the card footer. The page around it is the marketing hero's language, rendered by `AuthPage` (`apps/web/app/components/auth/page.tsx`): a `brand-1` wash fading into the page background with the radial `brand-2` glow at the top edge, and the notification cards. From `lg` up two cards flank the card on each side (anchored to the card's center at `14rem` plus the hero's `clamp(1.5rem, 6vw - 2.5rem, 10rem)` gap, `scale-85` until `xl`), and every four seconds one slot swaps to a notification not already on screen (0.5s ease-out fade and scale, the icon-museum feel, the one entrance the dashboard allows because sign-in is a rare surface); below `lg` four banners sit still around the card at 16% opacity as texture. Under reduced motion the cards render full and never swap. No logo above the card: the card and the cards around it carry the brand. The cards are `NotificationCard` over `SAMPLE_NOTIFICATIONS` (§9), the same component and sample apps the marketing hero draws, so both properties show one product. Sign in and create account are one form: header and footer swap instantly, Email, Password and the button never move, and the Name field rises out from behind Email (height, 24px translate, 0.95 scale, fade, 0.4s bounce-0 spring) when switching to create account. When GitHub is configured the card opens with a full-width `elevated` "Sign in with GitHub" / "Sign up with GitHub" button above an `or` divider, then the email form.

### The icon-swap standard

Whenever one icon or glyph replaces another in place — copy → check, step number → check, any stateful icon — both states swap with one recipe, shared from **`@buzzkit/ui/lib/icon-swap`**: the outgoing icon scales down to `0.65` as it fades out behind a subtle `2px` blur, and the incoming icon scales in from `0.65` as it fades in. Both at once, one duration — a simple symmetric cross-fade. Never toggle visibility, never scale from 0, never skip the blur.

CSS flavor — `iconSwap` + `iconSwapIn` / `iconSwapOut`; both icons stay mounted, absolute-stacked, so transitions retarget mid-swap:

```
base:   transition-[opacity,scale,filter] duration-200 ease-[cubic-bezier(0.2,0,0,1)]
shown:  scale-100 opacity-100 blur-none
hidden: scale-[0.65] opacity-0 blur-[2px]
```

motion/react flavor — `iconSwapMotion`, for `AnimatePresence`-driven swaps: same endpoints, `{ type: 'spring', duration: 0.3, bounce: 0 }`.

Reference implementations: the `CodeBlock` copy button and the conversation header's details toggle (CSS), the onboarding `StepMarker` (motion, `components/onboarding/guide-step.tsx`).

### Restraint

- **Frequency decides.** Anything triggered dozens of times a day — navigation, keyboard actions, list hovers — gets no animation. Occasional surfaces (dialogs, toasts) get the standard timings. Delight spends only on rare moments (first-run, success).
- **No entrance choreography.** Screens render settled — no staggered fly-ins, no per-section reveals. Motion belongs to state *changes*, not to arrival.
- **Waiting states use the live dot**, not a spinner: `LivePing` (`@buzzkit/ui/components/live-ping`) — a `size-2` solid `green-4` core under an `animate-ping` ring at 60% opacity (`motion-reduce:animate-none`), placed at the right edge of the waiting item's title and paired with a short label naming what it waits for, dot first: "● Waiting for user". A spinner means the *app* is working; the dot means the app is ready and *listening*.

### Reduced motion

`globals.css` carries one unlayered `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block that collapses every animation and transition to `0.01ms` and kills the skeleton pulse. **`.animate-spin` is exempt** — a spinner that stops spinning stops communicating progress. It is unlayered on purpose so it also beats sonner's injected stylesheet.

---

## 7. The press pattern

buzzkit controls press by deflating **only the background** by a fixed number of pixels. The label, icons and layout stay fixed, and every control deflates by the same amount whatever its width: a press is an **inset, never a ratio**, so a full-width dialog button, a sidebar row and a short "Create key" button all feel identical and nothing ever needs a per-instance override.

```tsx
// The fill and its shadow live on ::before, which is what deflates.
"before:absolute before:inset-0 before:-z-10 before:rounded-[inherit] before:content-['']",
'before:transition-[background-color,box-shadow,inset] before:duration-150 before:ease-out',
'enabled:active:before:inset-x-(--press-inset-x) enabled:active:before:inset-y-(--press-inset-y)',
```

- The amounts are two tokens in `globals.css`: `--press-inset-x: 1px`, `--press-inset-y: 0.5px`, calibrated on the default 32px button (where the old `scale(0.975)` deflated roughly 1.3px × 0.4px, a touch too strong). Tune them there, never in a component.
- `HighlightList` reads the same tokens and converts them to a per-item `scale(x, y)` on its sliding indicator, so menu items, select items, sidebar rows and choice rows deflate by the same pixels as buttons.
- Anything **without** content — checkbox, radio, icon-only buttons — scales itself (`0.95` / `0.975`): their size is fixed, so a ratio is already a constant.
- Link buttons and ghost tabs have no background, so the text itself scales to `0.975`.
- **Disabled controls never show press feedback.** Gate on `enabled:` / `not-data-disabled:`.
- Pressing a `<label>` presses its sibling control (handled in `globals.css`).

> Base UI renders checkbox/radio/switch as `<span>` + a hidden `<input>`, so `:enabled` / `:disabled` never match. Use `not-data-disabled:` and `data-disabled:` on those three.

### 7.1 Touch: `hover:` is desktop-only, so pair it with `active:`

Tailwind v4 compiles every `hover:` into `@media (hover: hover)`. That is the right default (it kills iOS sticky-hover), but it has a consequence that is easy to ship without noticing: **on a phone, a hover-only affordance does nothing at all.** A ghost button tapped on mobile looks broken, because its entire fill lives in `hover:`.

`active:` is not gated, so it is the channel that fires on touch. The rule:

```tsx
// Wrong — invisible on every phone.
'not-disabled:hover:before:bg-bg-a2/70'
// Right — same value, twice.
'not-disabled:hover:before:bg-bg-a2/70 not-disabled:active:before:bg-bg-a2/70'
```

Write the value **twice, identically**. Do not reach for a custom `tap:`/`hover:none` variant: `active:` also fires on keyboard activation (Space on a focused button), which a touch-gated variant would miss.

Pair whenever hover carries feedback a press should show: ghost/soft/link buttons, list rows, tabs, select triggers, attachments, prose links. Do **not** pair when hover is a pointer-only affordance with no tap meaning — the scrollbar thumb, the sidebar resize rail, or a hover that reveals a control a touch user reaches another way.

`-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent` is set on `html` so Safari's gray flash does not fight these states.

**A sliding highlight is pointer-only, so it must ask whether the device hovers.** `pointerenter` fires on a tap, which means a touch user pressing a row the pointer never hovered sends the indicator gliding to it — and on a row that changes nothing (an expandable nav group, which only unfolds) it slides down and straight back, reading as a glitch. Any component that drives a highlight from hover state gates it on `useHoverCapable()` (`@buzzkit/ui/hooks/use-hover-capable`, `(hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)`); the sidebar and the onboarding choice rows both do. It starts `false`, so SSR and the first paint never track hover, and with hover off the indicator simply rests where it belongs: on the active page. This is the counterpart to the `active:` rule above — press feedback is for everyone, a hover highlight is for pointers.

## 8. Icons

Country flags are `Flag` (`@buzzkit/ui/components/flag`): `<Flag code='DE' />` renders the 16px SVG from the app's `/flags/<code>.svg` (the set lives in `apps/web/public/flags`), decorative, with a 1px upward nudge so it sits on the text baseline next to the country name. Never an inline `<img>`.

Central Icons, exclusively:

```tsx
import { Icon } from '@buzzkit/ui/components/icon';
<Icon name='IconBell' className='size-4' />
```

- `scripts/generate-icons.ts` scans the repo for `name='Icon…'` and `icon: 'Icon…'` **string literals** and generates `paths.ts`. Never build a name dynamically, and never bury a name inside a conditional expression the scanner cannot see (`icon={ok ? A : B}` with inline strings works only if both literals appear somewhere as literals — hoist conditional icon names into constants at the top of the module). A missed name renders nothing, silently. The generator runs before dev/build/check-types.
- Icons paint via `currentColor`; state comes from CSS color, never a second asset.
- Default `size-4` (16px) inside controls; one stroke weight across the set.
- Decorative icons get `aria-hidden` automatically. Pass `ariaLabel` to make one meaningful (it then gets `role="img"`).
- Icons are generated in Central's **raw** mode: plain paths with `currentColor`, no `<mask>`, no ids. Render the same icon as often as you like, hidden or not; the masked mode's shared ids once turned a select's checkmark into a black rectangle whenever the first copy sat in a closed popup.
- `IconCheckmark1` is the checkmark, with `rotate-[4deg]` — the other checkmarks in the set are optically wrong at small sizes.
- **Glyph icons are solid: append `Filled`** (`IconPeopleFilled`, `IconTagFilled`) — any catalog name renders filled with the suffix. Outline is only for icons that have no meaningful fill: chevrons, arrows, checkmarks, the spinner.
- Filled icons render at **50% opacity automatically** (in the `Icon` component) — solid glyphs carry more ink than strokes, so this keeps both at the same visual weight. Override with an `opacity-*` class when a filled icon must be full-strength.
- **State lifts the opacity, on a 200ms fade:** menu and select items raise their icons to 100% while the sliding highlight sits on them (`data-indicator-here`); sidebar nav items raise theirs to **85%** for the active and highlighted item — text goes full `fg-4`, the icon stays a step quieter.

Components with an `icon` prop (`Button`, `Badge`, menu items) accept `icon='IconBell'` or `icon={{ name: 'IconBell', position: 'inline-end' }}`, and trim 2px of padding on the icon's side so the glyph sits optically level with the text edge.

---

## 9. Components

All from `@buzzkit/ui/components/<name>`.

### Button

A button's `loading` prop is the only busy state: it disables the button and swaps the icon for a spinner (leading when there is no icon) while the label stays, so the width and the meaning hold; never compose `{pending && <Spinner />}` by hand. Icon buttons keep their label 6px (`gap-1.5`) from the glyph at every size, not 8px (plain text buttons keep `gap-2`; the gap only matters once there is an icon): Central icons carry generous viewboxes, so the optical gap is already wider than the number. Chevrons are the extreme case and get their own treatment inside `Button` (`data-chevron`, set automatically for any `IconChevron*`): 16px glyph, 2px gap, 5px edge padding. Never tune these per instance.

`variant`: `default` · `elevated` · `soft` · `ghost` · `destructive` · `link`
`size`: `xs` (26px) · `sm` (30px) · `default` (32px) · `lg` (36px), plus `icon-xs` · `icon-sm` · `icon` · `icon-lg`
`icon`: `MenuItemIcon`

`default` is the single primary action on a view. `elevated` is the neutral workhorse. `soft` and `ghost` are secondary and tertiary; `ghost` rests in `fg-2` and only turns `fg-4` on hover and press, so a row of ghost actions reads as chrome until you reach for it. `destructive` only for irreversible actions. Use `xs` inside dense chrome such as a card footer.

A `Button` also announces itself to an optional `ActionRegistryProvider` above it (`@buzzkit/ui/components/action-registry`: `register({ id, label, icon, activate }) => unregister`, the label read from string children, `activate` clicking the rendered element, nothing registered while the button is disabled or loading), so a host can list the buttons in a region as commands; with no provider the hook is inert. Both this provider and the filter bar's are built on one primitive, `createRegistryContext<T>(name)` in `@buzzkit/ui/components/registry`, which returns a `RegistryProvider` taking `register` and a `useRegister` that reads it; a third self-announcing control uses the same call rather than a new context. The dashboard's `PageHeader` provides it around its actions for the command menu.

### Badge

A value that belongs to a vocabulary (key kind, platform, channel, message or delivery status, webhook or source outcome, role, environment) is never a hand-written `Badge` on a page: `apps/web/app/components/badges` owns the label and the color for each value, one component per value set (`KeyKindBadge`, `PlatformBadge`, `MessageStatusBadge`, `DeliveryStatusBadge`, `WebhookStatusBadge`, `SourceStatusBadge`, `RoleBadge`, and the rest — the file is the inventory), so iOS is blue and Android purple on every screen without anyone remembering. Add a value there first, then use it.

`variant`: `default` · `purple` · `sky` · `blue` · `green` · `amber` · `orange` · `red` · `pink` · `solid`
`size`: `sm` (20px, `text-xs`) · `default` (24px, `text-sm`)

Status chips: `-1` tint + `-text`. Never interactive — if it needs a click, it is a Button.

### Input / Textarea

34px tall, `rounded-xl`, `bg-bg-2`. Focus draws a 1.5px outline plus ring; `aria-invalid` draws a 1px `red-4` ring at rest, so an error stays visible after leaving the field, and the focus ring turns red and thickens to 1.5px while editing. Read-only fields keep a quieter focus ring — never remove it. Textarea auto-grows via `field-sizing-content`.

Fields that fetch as you type (the subscribers lookup) take `loading`: the spinner fades in at the trailing edge, the field never grows a button. Searching is automatic, 300ms after the last keystroke, and the busy state covers both the wait and the navigation.

**Every field needs a real `<Label htmlFor>`.** A placeholder shows the expected format, never the label.

### Select

One trigger size, matching the default button (32px, `rounded-xl`). The popup aligns the selected item over the trigger (`alignItemWithTrigger`), takes the trigger's width via `w-(--anchor-width)`, and `SelectValue` mirrors the selected item's icon. Only the popup's surface animates in (it lives on `::before`; the list itself is the scroll container and its text lands instantly): over the trigger (Base UI's `data-side="none"`) the surface grows 0.975 → 1 from its center in 150ms ease-out, picking up exactly where the trigger's press scale (`0.975`) let go; beside the trigger it fades in while growing from 95%. Closing is instant, no exit animation. Item padding is tuned so the aligned popup sits exactly over the trigger (list 4px + item 6px = trigger 10px).

### Combobox

`@buzzkit/ui/components/combobox`, a Select you can type into: `ComboboxInput` is the field language of an input (`bg-bg-2`, `rounded-xl`, the same focus ring) with the chevron as the trigger inside it (`showTrigger={false}` drops it where the field should feel like a plain input, as in the segment builder); the popup is the Select's surface at least the field's width and as wide as its longest item, its height animating through `SizeAnimator` as the list filters, the list capped at 288px with `ScrollFade` and the sliding highlight (`useAnimatedIndicator`) inside it. Both re-measure as the list filters: `ScrollFade` watches the container's children (a filtered list swaps them wholesale, so a fade that only observed the first render stayed on), and the highlight parks itself at the origin with zero size when its item leaves the DOM (an invisible pill left at its old offset still counts towards the scrollable overflow, which kept a one-item list "scrollable" and its fade visible). Base UI filters the items as you type; the popup simply disappears when nothing matches (pass `empty` to show a line instead), and a caller that owns `inputValue` keeps typed text on blur by only accepting `input-change` / `item-press` / `clear-press` reasons, so a picker over a catalog (event names in the segment builder) works as a plain input for names the catalog has not seen yet. Long values overflow like any input's. Rows that must stay 32px pass `h-8 px-2.5` like every other row input.

### ScopePicker

`@buzzkit/ui/components/scope-picker`, the one picker for permission-like strings (API key scopes, webhook events, later agent scopes): a search field over collapsible groups. A group row carries a checkbox that stands for the group's wildcard (`subscribers:*`; groups without one select every option), the wildcard or label in `text-xs` (Open Runde like everything else, per §3), a count (`all`, `2`), and a chevron that rotates 90° in 150ms; its options fold open and closed with the sidebar's springs (unfold 0.3s, fold 0.2s, bounce 0, height auto + opacity). Picking every option of a group collapses the selection back into its wildcard; searching expands every matching group. Rows press with the shared inset tokens.

### Checkbox · Radio · Switch

18px, 18px, and 32×20 with a 16px knob. Each expands its hit area with `after:-inset-x-3 after:-inset-y-2` so the target clears 24×24 without growing visually. All three take `cursor-pointer` unless disabled.

### Tabs

`variant`: `default` (segmented — a sliding pill on `bg-bg-2`) · `ghost` (bare text switchers, no indicator; the content itself presses).

### PillTabs

Free-floating pill pickers (no track): header nav, inbox status filters, composer modes. **The pill is a clip-path window, never a color transition**: an aria-hidden copy of the label row in the inverted color sits on the pill background, clipped by an animated `inset(… round 9999px)` — mid-slide a label splits at the pill edge instead of cross-fading. `variant`: `primary` (black pill, inverted labels) · `amber` (internal-mode composer picker) · `soft` (`bg-bg-2`). On first mount the pill snaps to position and fades in over 150ms; only value changes animate the slide. Interactive elements are buttons by default; pass `renderItem` for router Links. A strip that filters rather than navigates takes a `label` ("Status", "Outcome", "Time") and then announces itself to the filter registry as a non-clearable facet, exactly like a `FilterSelect`; a strip without a label is a view switcher and announces nothing. Keep the root padding-free (the overlay aligns to its box) — pad a wrapper instead. A strip that drives a loader (the Events time range) takes `loading`: the pill slides to the value you picked at once, then the whole strip goes disabled and fades to 50% until the data lands — every item, not just the active one, because a strip is one picker. **No spinner here**, unlike `FilterSelect`: the pill has already moved and the labels must not change width mid-slide, so the dim carries the state on its own.


The clip window is driven by two numeric springs (one per edge, identical config: a 200ms visual-duration spring, bounce 0, quicker than the 0.3s the rest of the system uses because the pill moves on every filter change and must feel instant) combined into the `clip-path` string every frame, never by animating the string itself: interpolating the string lets the two edges move at different rates, and the pill visibly stretches across every tab in between. A re-measure that lands on the same target (the page re-rendering while the pill is mid-slide) leaves the springs alone; only a genuinely new target snaps or slides.

### Nav lists (sidebars)

Vertical navs (the workspace sidebar, the `/ui` section nav) and pickers (the onboarding choice rows) share the menu mechanic via `useAnimatedIndicator`: one `bg-a2` highlight that **rests on the active item**, slides to the hovered item, and glides back on pointer leave — items never draw their own hover background. Text runs `fg-2` → `fg-4` under the indicator and stays `fg-4` on the active item; both transitions run 200ms so switching tabs shifts color instead of snapping. Group headers are quiet `text-xs fg-2` labels above their items. Active state must always be knowable with the pointer elsewhere.

### CodeBlock

Copyable snippet on `bg-bg-2`, `rounded-xl`: `text-xs` in the regular face, horizontal `ScrollFade` (hidden scrollbar, fade hint), clipboard button top-right on a solid `bg-bg-2` backing so scrolled code never shows through beneath it. The clipboard flips to a full-strength `green-4` checkmark for 1.5s via the icon-swap standard (§6) — it confirms the copy succeeded. No syntax highlighting — deliberately plain.

### Command menu

`@buzzkit/ui/components/command` wraps [cmdk](https://github.com/dip/cmdk) in the menu grammar, so a command palette reads as a tall dropdown: `Command` · `CommandInput` (a 39px row, `px-2.5`, with the magnifying glass, an optional `start` crumb and `end` slot, hairline below) · `CommandList` (the scroll viewport, `p-1`, capped at `min(24rem, 60dvh)`, wrapped in `SizeAnimator` so the palette's height glides as typing changes the result count instead of jumping; no `ScrollFade`, like every menu popup, because a mask on the scroller would dim the highlight on the first and last rows, exactly where arrow keys park it) · `CommandGroup` (cmdk's heading restyled to the quiet `text-xs fg-2` label) · `CommandItem` (the dropdown item's metrics: `rounded-lg`, `py-1.5 px-2`, `fg-3` lifting to `fg-4` under the highlight, `icon` as on menu items) · `CommandHint` (the muted qualifier after a label: the group a page belongs to, the entity an action applies to) · `CommandShortcut` (`keys` as `Kbd` chips at the right edge) · `CommandSeparator` · `CommandEmpty` · `CommandFooter` (a 36px strip of `Kbd` hints). **One sliding highlight** follows cmdk's selection: the list runs `useAnimatedIndicator` on `data-selected="true"` (the hook takes a `value` for attributes that are always present and flip), so keyboard and pointer both move the same indicator and no item paints its own hover. `CommandDialog` is the palette form: a `Dialog` pinned at `max(3rem, 14vh)` from the top rather than centered, so it does not jump as results change, 560px wide, `rounded-2xl` (a deliberate step past the concentric 12px, because the palette reads as a surface like a dialog rather than a popup), no padding, an `sr-only` title. It takes `finalFocus` through to the popup so a command that opens another dialog can decline the focus restore that would otherwise fight the new dialog's trap. The dashboard's menu is `apps/web/app/components/command/menu.tsx` (`docs/dashboard.md`, Command menu).

### DropdownMenu

Items share one sliding highlight from `HighlightList` rather than each drawing its own hover. `DropdownMenuItem variant='destructive'` tints the indicator red. Submenus offset 12px. **`DropdownMenuLabel` must sit inside a `DropdownMenuGroup`** — Base UI throws otherwise, which kills hydration silently.

### Dialog / AlertDialog

Dialogs carry a title and the form, nothing else: no `DialogDescription` restating what the fields already say. `AlertDialog` is the exception, its description is the consequence the user is confirming.


Centered, 420px (`size='sm'` → `max-w-xs`), `rounded-3xl`, 20px padding (`p-5`), 16px between header, body and footer. Title (`text-xl`) over description (`text-sm`), both centered and balanced, 2px apart (`gap-0.5`). AlertDialog is for destructive confirms: two actions splitting the width 50/50, and the confirm button **repeats the consequence** ("Delete workspace", never "Delete").

### IconTile

A glyph on a soft `bg-2` surface, the one way an icon sits on its own: `size` `sm` (32px tile, 18px glyph: dense rows, card titles) · `default` (34px / 20px, the input height: choice rows) · `lg` (48px / 28px: empty states, headers). It always wears its 1px `bg-4/70` hairline ring; that ring is part of the component, not something a caller adds, and there is no ring-less variant. `tone` themes it in any accent ramp (`green` for success, `red` for errors, …): the glyph takes the ramp's `-4` at 85% (red, the loudest ramp, at 70%), the fill is `-4` at 15%, the ring `-4` at 25%, so one rule covers every color and both themes. Callers never compose these classes by hand. Never change its fill on hover. `EmptyState`, the file drop zone, the icon gallery on `/ui` and every list row that leads with an icon use it; a glyph on a surface is never hand-rolled.

### Time

Every time the UI shows, relative or absolute (created, updated, last used, last seen), is hoverable and reveals the exact time: `TimeAgo` (relative, ticks every minute) and `Time` (`Aug 24, 2026`) in `apps/web/app/hooks/use-time-ago.tsx`, both rendering a `<time dateTime>` with a 150ms-delay tooltip carrying `exactTime` (`Aug 24, 2026, 12:58 PM`). A bare `formatDate()` in JSX is a bug.

### Table

`@buzzkit/ui/components/table`. Lives inside a `Card`, edge to edge, under a `CardHeader divider` (the hairline between a title-only header and an edge-to-edge body belongs to the header, so it stays put when the body scrolls; it hides itself above an `EmptyState`, and cards with padded `CardContent` never use it): hairline rows (`border-bg-3`), header cells `text-xs` `text-fg-2` at 36px, body cells `text-sm` `text-fg-3` with the identifying column `font-medium text-fg-4`, 12px horizontal padding and 16px at the card edges. Every cell is `whitespace-nowrap` and the wrapper is `overflow-auto`, so a narrow viewport scrolls the table sideways and never the page. **That sideways scroll announces itself**: the viewport carries a horizontal `ScrollFade`, so a table with more to the right fades at that edge and the fade swaps sides as you scroll, which is the only cue on a phone that the columns continue. The fade is horizontal only — a vertical mask would fade out the sticky header — and `table-fixed` is dropped under `lg` (`max-lg:table-auto`), because a fixed layout whose sized columns exceed the card gives the unsized column zero width and paints one header over the next. `Table` is a column: a scroll viewport (`overflow-auto`, `min-h-0 flex-1`) holding the `<table>`, and below it anything that must never scroll. The header is sticky inside the viewport (`border-separate` table, hairlines drawn on cells so the sticky row keeps its line); when a page pins the table, the card takes `min-h-0` and the rows scroll in both directions while `TablePagination`, composed as the last child of `Table` and lifted out of the viewport by it, stays put across the full width: a 36px row (`border-t`, `text-xs`) holding "Page 1 / 3 (131)" (NumberFlow, the total in `fg-1`) and Previous / Next as `xs` ghost buttons that navigate through `LinkProvider`; it only exists when there is more than one page. Rows are not pressed and have no hover; table cells use `cursor: auto` (set in `globals.css`), so the I-beam appears only over the glyphs and the arrow over a cell's whitespace; per-row actions sit in a trailing `…` menu in a `w-0` cell. An expandable row (the audit log, the event stream, a message's deliveries) carries a trailing chevron that rotates 180° in 150ms and opens a `TableDetail` beneath it: one full-width cell whose content folds open and closed with the sidebar's springs (unfold 0.3s, fold 0.2s, bounce 0, height auto + opacity); the detail row is only in the DOM while open or folding, so the last-row hairline rule still holds. A row's category gets its own column as a `Badge size='sm'`, one color per category (keys: Workspace blue, Tenant purple, Client green); state badges (`Revoked`, red) sit after the name; secondary counts (scopes) carry a dotted underline and a tooltip listing the detail; empty values say the word (`Never`, `All tenants`) in `text-fg-2` rather than a dash. Every time in a table goes through `Time` / `TimeAgo` (exact time on hover).

### Avatar

People and workspaces with a picture use `AvatarImage`. Everything else gets a generated picture, never an initial, and which picture says who it is. **Subscribers** (your users' customers, identified by an external id) get a face: `<Avatar name={externalId} />` loads a deterministic Kodama character (`api.kodama.sh`, circle, subtle depth, a happy / surprised / cool mood, blink and eyebrow animations) through `BlurImage`, with the first letter as the placeholder while it loads, so the same id always has the same face across the list, the profile and the Overview. **Signed-in people** (the account menu, workspace members) get `picture='orb'`: a `PastelAvatar` **orb**, a lit sphere in a single accent ramp (`-3` shading to `-2` towards a plain white highlight) picked from the email with its own hash; **workspaces** get the `PastelAvatar` tile (a diagonal blend of two neighboring ramps on a superellipse). Orbs and tiles are pure tokens, so they render on the server, follow the theme and need no network; faces are the one generated picture that comes from outside, which is right for subscribers (thousands of them, each meant to look like a person) and wrong for the handful of teammates whose avatars sit in the chrome of every page. `AvatarFallback` (initials) remains for a person whose real image fails to load.

### BlurImage

`@buzzkit/ui/components/blur-image`: an `<img>` inside a `bg-3` frame, `opacity-0 blur-[4px]` until `load` (or already complete from cache), then `opacity-100 blur-0` on a 300ms ease-out; an optional `placeholder` sits centered underneath. Use it for any remote picture that would otherwise pop in.

### EmptyState

Every empty state is an `EmptyState`, never a sentence, with no exceptions: an empty list, a lookup that found nothing, a filter with no matches, an empty section inside a card. Title is the plain fact, short ("No subscriber found", "No API keys yet", "No topics yet"), the description says where the first one comes from or what to check, quoting the user's own input in curly quotes. Inside a card use `size='sm'`: a 32px tile, `text-sm` title, `text-xs` description, `p-6` with half the top padding (`pt-3`) because the card title above already carries its own.

`icon` · `title` · `description?` · one optional action as `children`. **The** blank-slate treatment: glyph in a `size-12` `bg-bg-2` tile, title over description, at most one Button. Every "nothing here yet", "cannot load this" and "pick something" surface uses it, in the dashboard and the widget alike. Never hand-roll another one, and never give it two actions.

### Sheet

`side`: `top` · `right` · `bottom` · `left`. Header and footer stay pinned; scrolling content goes in `SheetBody`.

**The panel only slides, it never fades** — a full translate from off-screen (`transition-[translate]`, 200ms `ease-out`), both directions. Fading a panel that also moves reads as unclean, so only the backdrop fades. Put the primary action (`New conversation`, `Save`) in `SheetFooter`, not the header.

### Drawer

Draggable panel on [vaul](https://vaul.emilkowal.ski). Same anatomy as Sheet (`DrawerHeader` / `DrawerBody` / `DrawerFooter`, primary action in the footer), and `DrawerContent` styles itself from vaul's `data-vaul-drawer-direction`, so one component covers every side.

**`responsive` is the house default.** A full-width bottom sheet on a desktop viewport is absurd, and a 310px side panel on a phone is worse, so `<Drawer responsive>` resolves the direction from the breakpoint: **bottom** under 768px (96% height, `rounded-t-3xl`, drag handle, background scales behind it) and **left** above it (an inset panel, `top-2 bottom-2 left-2`, `rounded-3xl`, `shadow-4`, no handle). Both directions still drag to dismiss; the side panel travels its width plus the 8px inset via `--initial-transform`.

**Drawer vs Sheet:** a drawer is *dragged*, a sheet is *opened*. Vaul is Radix-based, so its trigger takes `asChild`, not Base UI's `render`.

### NavigationMenu

`@buzzkit/ui/components/navigation-menu`, Base UI's navigation menu for site chrome (the marketing header; the dashboard sidebar stays a `HighlightList`). Triggers are the ghost text style at 32px with a chevron that turns on open; the popup is a portaled `rounded-xl` `bg-bg-1` surface on `shadow-3` that opens 8px below the trigger and **morphs between contents** instead of closing and reopening: the positioner slides to the new trigger and the popup animates its width and height on the sliding-indicator curve (250ms, `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)`) while the outgoing content fades and shifts 32px in the direction of travel. Hover intent is Base UI's, so crossing the gap into the panel never closes it. Items are `NavigationMenuLink`s (`rounded-lg`, `bg-bg-a2/70` hover); a grid of them with an icon tile and a one-line summary is the menu shape, and a sliding highlight inside the grid follows the pointer the way the sidebar's does.

### Popover / Tooltip

Popover: 288px, `rounded-xl`, title + description with no gap. Tooltip: a 24px dark chip, `rounded-lg`, no arrow — the 4px offset reads as attached. A `Kbd` inside a tooltip inverts automatically.

### Card

`rounded-2xl`, `px-4 py-4`. Header drops to `pb-[13px]` when a `CardContent` follows (the onboarding card tightens that to `pb-2.5`). `CardAction` puts a control at the right; Only the title and the description set a header's height: every sibling that follows `CardTitle` (a `CardAction`, pill tabs, a button, a live count) is taken out of flow (absolutely positioned at the header's right edge, vertically centered), so controls keep their own size, sit centered on the title block, and the header is exactly as tall as its title (and description) alone, with no per-page margin hacks. `CardFooter` is a bordered 48px strip; a ghost button at its left edge takes `-ml-2` so its label aligns with the card content.

### Toast

`toast.success | error | warning | info | loading` from `@buzzkit/ui/components/sonner`. Firing the same kind+message twice pings the existing toast (shake for error/warning, bump otherwise) instead of stacking a duplicate. `toast.loading` is a promise toast underneath, so settling it by id cross-fades the spinner into the result icon. Toasts are translucent + blurred; their CSS is unlayered so it beats sonner's own stylesheet.

### FilterBar

Every filterable table gets the same row above it: `FilterBar` holding, left to right, one `FilterSelect` per facet whose empty state reads "Any status" / "Any channel" and whose trigger turns `fg-4` once something is picked, a `FilterClear` ghost button that only appears while anything is active, and on the far right a `FilterSearch` (a magnifying-glass input with the debounced `loading` spinner). The bar is `justify-between`: the facets form one group on the left, the search field sits alone on the right. It pulls the table 10px closer (`-mb-2.5` against the page's 20px rhythm, so 10px), because it belongs to the table, not to the page. The components are fully controlled and know nothing about routing: the dashboard's `useFilters` hook keeps the values in the URL (`?q=&status=&…`), drops the page cursor whenever a filter changes, and applies typed search 300ms after the last keystroke. **A facet answers the click, not the loader**: `useFilters` reads the pending navigation's parameters, so the trigger names the value you just picked on the same frame the popup closes, and that one facet takes `loading` — a spinner in place of its chevron and the trigger disabled, which means 50% opacity like every other disabled control, until the rows land. Only the facet you touched reacts: the others keep their chevrons, their full opacity and their clicks. If you click a second facet before the rows land, both stay loading — pending is every key that still differs from the URL at the start of this load, not only the last click. Clearing is the one exception to the "the control you touched" rule in the other direction: the facets all snap back to "Any …" at once and go disabled, dimmed and without a spinner, while only `FilterClear` spins, mounted through the load instead of vanishing under the cursor. The search field's spinner belongs to the query alone — no facet, and no clear, ever spins it. Time is its own facet, `FilterRange`: a select of presets (the dashboard passes Last 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, 12 months; the API takes any `from` / `to`, the presets are only convenience) plus a "Custom range" item that, instead of selecting, opens a `Popover` anchored to the trigger with a two-month range `Calendar` (react-day-picker restyled to the tokens: 32px cells, neighboring months' days in `fg-1` so each month reads on its own, today on a `bg-a1` tile, `bg-a1` for the span, `primary-4` for the two ends, future days disabled), a live "Jun 3 – Jun 17" readout and Cancel / Apply. Applying emits `YYYY-MM-DD..YYYY-MM-DD`, which the select then shows as its own item ("Jun 3 – Jun 17"), so the trigger always names the window; presets emit their key. The page turns either into `from` / `to` for the API (`resolveRange` in `use-filters.ts`; custom days run from 00:00 to 23:59:59 UTC). A facet with many values passes groups instead of a flat list (`{ label, options }[]`, rendered as `SelectGroup`s with a quiet `SelectLabel` each; the Events page lists thirty event names under their object), the "Any …" item staying first and ungrouped. Never invent per-page chips or "Add filter" menus; the facets are few and fixed, so show them. Every `FilterSelect` and `FilterRange` also announces itself to whatever `FilterRegistryProvider` sits above it (`@buzzkit/ui/components/filter-registry`, which owns the facet and search-field shapes and the `useRegisterFacet` / `useRegisterSearchField` hooks so `PillTabs` can share them) (`register(facet) => unregister`, with the label, plain-string options, current value and `onValueChange`; a disabled control, such as a facet on a cold load, does not register, so nothing can pick a filter the bar itself refuses). `FilterSearch` takes `onValueChange` next to the native `onChange` and, when given, announces a `kind: 'search'` entry with its placeholder as the label, so a host can offer “Search messages for …” from elsewhere and type into the field; the provider is optional and the design system knows nothing about what it feeds, which in the dashboard is the command menu (`docs/dashboard.md`, Command menu).

### Charts

Charts are **bklit** components (`https://bklit.com`, a shadcn registry, `@bklit/*` in `packages/ui/components.json`) installed into `packages/ui/src/components/charts/` with `bunx shadcn add @bklit/area-chart`, so the source is ours like every other shadcn piece: visx for geometry, `motion` for the entrance and tween animations, SVG output. It is a chart library, not a component, so the folder is kept legible: the four files pages import sit at the top (`area-chart.tsx` with `AreaChart`, `area.tsx` with `Area`, `grid.tsx`, `x-axis.tsx`) next to `tooltip/` (`chart-tooltip.tsx` and its box, dot, indicator and date ticker), and the engine underneath is grouped by job: `engine/` (the time-series shell, contexts, phases, scales and domains, the interaction and tooltip-scheduling hooks), `series/` (path geometry and the data-change morph, gradients, edge fades, markers, highlight and hover-dim layers, dash tails), `loading/` (the sweep, pulse and shimmer skeleton states plus the loading label) and `overlays/` (projections, reference areas, pattern fills). Everything the dashboard does not reach was deleted rather than kept for later: the bar chart stack (`bar-chart`, `bar`, `bar-squares`, both bar axes and the stacked-bar patches that came with them), bklit's `legend/`, both loading skeleton wrappers, the pattern presets and a few orphan hooks; `bunx shadcn add @bklit/bar-chart` brings bars back in one command (then restore `button.tsx` and `utils.ts`, which the CLI overwrites). What we changed after installing: every `--chart-*` and `--legend-*` variable bklit injects into `globals.css` points at a token (`--chart-foreground: var(--fg-4)`, `--chart-grid: var(--bg-3)`, `--chart-tooltip-background: var(--fg-4)` with `--background` text and `--fg-1` as the tooltip's muted color (bklit's `bg-4` was invisible on the inverted surface), the neutral `--chart-1..5` ramp on `fg-4 → bg-4`), and the light and dark blocks it wrote are one tokenised block, since the tokens already flip. Series colors are passed explicitly as raw ramp variables (`var(--green-4)`, `var(--red-4)`, `var(--sky-4)`, `var(--purple-4)`), never via `--chart-line-primary`. `AreaChart` derives its reveal clip id with `useId` (a local change: bklit hard-codes `chart-area-grow-clip`, so several area charts on one page were all clipped by the first one's width) and takes `interactive` (default true; `false` for sparklines, so hovering them shows neither a crosshair cursor nor a tooltip). When a chart's data changes in place (a new time range on the Overview), `Area` no longer swaps the data and tweens the y-domain, which drew the new series against the old scale and let a taller data set pour in from above the plot: it morphs the series in pixel space instead (`useAnimatedSeriesPath`: the old shape is resampled at the new x positions and only the heights tween, the target re-read every frame so a snapping domain is followed), so the series is full width from the first frame, stays inside the plot, and glides vertically from one shape to the other; the fill is drawn from the same points (`seriesAreaFromPoints`). Pair it with `yDomainTween={false}` so the scale snaps and the path carries the motion. `XAxis` takes `offset` (px from the chart's bottom edge to the labels, bklit's 12 by default), `ticks` (a predicate over the point's date and index that says which points carry a label, replacing bklit's evenly spaced pick) and `format` (the label from a date), and `ChartTooltip` takes `title` (the heading from the hovered point, any React node, so a qualifier can sit in `text-chart-tooltip-muted` next to the value), all local additions so a page can label a time axis by its own interval (hours, weekdays, Mondays, months) instead of the fixed short date; both axis files also keep the hovered label in place when `tickerHalfWidth` is 0 (bklit faded it out). Import from the file paths (`@buzzkit/ui/components/charts/area-chart`, `.../grid`, `.../x-axis`, `.../tooltip/chart-tooltip`); there is no barrel, and nothing under `engine/`, `series/`, `loading/` or `overlays/` is imported from outside the folder. Rules of use: one color per series, a legend for two or more series (the `Key` dots in the card action), tooltips on every chart, gridlines solid and hairline (`strokeDasharray='none'`), text in text tokens. Sparklines are `AreaChart` with no axes, no tooltip, `fadeEdges` and `gradientToOpacity={0}` in a fixed-height box (`aspectRatio='auto'`). Anything that is not a chart primitive (a stat tile, a legend row) lives in the page that uses it until a second page needs it.

### PastelAvatar

Workspaces never show an initial: a workspace without an uploaded picture gets a **pastel gradient tile**, a `linear-gradient` between two *neighboring* accent ramps (`purple-2 → pink-3`, `sky-2 → blue-3`, `green-2 → yellow-3`, …) picked deterministically from the slug, with a soft radial highlight in the top corner so it reads as a rounded object. The highlight is plain white in both themes (a specular glow does not turn black at night), and every ramp stop goes through `light-dark()`: the `-2` / `-3` ramp by day, and by night the accent `-4` lifted toward white (45% for the light stop, 25% for the dark one), because the dark ramps' own `-2` / `-3` are deep and saturated and would turn the tiles into neon. The root sets `color-scheme` per theme so `light-dark()` and native controls follow the toggle. Otherwise it is built entirely from the ramp tokens, so it renders on the server, follows the theme and sits in the same family as the badges. A shader-generated avatar was tried and dropped: too strong for a soft, playful palette. People keep initials or their uploaded image; the gradient is for workspaces.

### NotificationCard

What a delivered push looks like on the device, as an illustration: `w-72`, `rounded-[22px]`, `shadow-3`, a `PastelAvatar` seeded by the app name. Three kinds share one `Notification` type: a `banner` (title, body, the `when` caption in `fg-1`), `actions` (two action pills on `bg-2`) and an `activity` (a Live Activity on `fg-4` with a progress bar, `selection-inverse`). `SAMPLE_NOTIFICATIONS` is the one pool of sample apps (Gymly, Nook, Ledger, Trail, Dune, Pace, Harbor) every illustration draws from, so the marketing hero, the feature vignettes, the 404 page and the dashboard's auth pages all show the same product. Sample data only; never render a real message through it.

### Truncate

`Truncate` is the only way to cut a line of data-driven text: it renders `truncate` and, when the text really is clipped (measured with a `ResizeObserver`, so it follows resizes), shows the full text in a tooltip after the same 150ms every time stamp uses. Text that fits never gets a tooltip. A bare `<span className='truncate'>` is fine for static labels only (navigation, headings); names, descriptions, addresses, message titles, endpoints go through `Truncate`.

### Tooltips are for scanning

A tooltip is read in the half second the pointer rests, so its content is shaped to be scanned, not read: the **value first in the foreground** (`text-background` on the dark chip), the **qualifier in `TooltipLabel`** (`fg-1`, the same muted step the chart tooltip uses), and **states in their status color** (`green-4` sent, `red-4` failed, `amber-4` pending, the color dropped when the count is zero so a zero never shouts). Compare "Scheduled for 2026-08-30 09:00 local time" with the label and zone muted and the moment bright, or "7 reachable · 6 sent · 1 failed · 0 pending" with each count wearing its status, to the same strings in one color. Exact-time tooltips show the date bright and the clock time muted. Lists (recipients, scopes, event names) stay one item per line in the foreground. The chip is an inline flex row (for the `Kbd` chips), so mixed bright/muted text goes inside one `span` (`whitespace-nowrap` for the short ones), never as loose fragments, or each fragment wraps on its own line. Never a sentence where a value and its label will do.

**Content on the tooltip's inverted surface is recolored for it, never reused chrome.** A light-surface tint (`bg-*-1`) disappears against the dark chip. When a truncated set of chips or list items expands on hover, the tooltip shows the same vocabulary in its text form — bright values, muted qualifiers, one item per line — not the chips themselves.

### ScrollArea / ScrollFade

Both fade the scrolling edges with a **mask on the scrolling element**, never a gradient overlay — an overlay has to guess the surface behind it and paints over the container's own border. `ScrollArea` adds a custom auto-hiding scrollbar; `ScrollFade` decorates a plain overflow container (or an existing one via `targetRef`). Native scrollbars are hidden on every element inside the page by `globals.css`, never on `html` or `body`: WebKit stops drawing the native document scrollbar as soon as any `::-webkit-scrollbar` rule matches it, so the document scrollbar is each app's call in its own stylesheet (the dashboard hides it in `app.css`; the marketing site keeps it native by never touching it). Fade size is `--fade-size`; edges animate via `@property`-registered lengths.

Every overflow region on a dashboard page gets one — a content column, a side column, a table viewport — there is no bare `overflow-auto` without fades. A detail page with a side column is two independent scroll columns, each with its own fade, never one page scroller whose fade also dims the column that is not scrolling. The columns are wheel-linked: a wheel over either column also moves the other by the same delta (each clamps on its own), so the page scrolls as one no matter where the pointer is, and a short side column still scrolls the content. And an overflow container never hugs its cards: give it a few pixels of padding pulled back with a matching negative margin (`-m-1 p-1`, `-mx-8.5 px-8.5`) so the 1px ring and shadow of the first and edge cards are not clipped at the scroller's edge.

### Chat pieces — shared by the dashboard and the widget

The two chat surfaces render the same things, so the shared parts live here rather than twice:

- `MessageAttachments` — the tile row under a bubble (image thumbnail, or `FileTypeIcon` with the extension stamped on it). Takes a structural `MessageAttachment`, which both the workspace and client message serializers satisfy.
- `useAttachmentUploads` (`@buzzkit/ui/hooks/use-attachment-uploads`) — the composer's attachment state: 25 MB and empty-file validation, per-file upload status, removal. **The transport is injected**, because it legitimately differs: the dashboard posts to its own route so the browser never holds the API token, the widget uploads straight to the client files door with its client token.
- `AttachmentUploads` — the pending chips that pair with the hook.
- `formatBytes` (`@buzzkit/ui/lib/bytes`).

What stays per-app: the composer *shells* (the dashboard has internal-mode tabs and drag-and-drop and submits through a React Router fetcher; the widget calls a promise), and message rendering, because the dashboard shows internal messages and suggestions the client API must never serialize.

### Others

`Avatar` (+ `Image`, `Fallback`, `Badge`, `Group`, `GroupCount`) · `Separator` · `Skeleton` · `Spinner` · `Kbd` / `KbdGroup` (an 18px `bg-2` chip, `rounded-[5px]`, with the same inset `bg-4/70` hairline ring as `IconTile`, so it reads as a key and not a highlight; on a tooltip's dark chip both fill and ring switch to `background` at low alpha) · `SizeAnimator` (animates height around changing content) · `HighlightList` / `useAnimatedIndicator` (the sliding-indicator primitive; `attribute` names the item attribute and `value` pins it to one value for attributes that are always present and flip, as cmdk's `data-selected` does) · `FileTypeIcon`.

## 10. Writing

- **Never an em dash, never an en dash, in any user-facing string.** Use a period, a comma, or a colon; spell ranges out ("3 to 48"). This covers labels, captions, errors, empty states, aria text — everything a user can read. (Code comments and this doc are exempt.)
- Meta titles join with a middle dot: `Acme · BuzzKit`. The product is written **BuzzKit** everywhere a user can read it, including example values inside illustrations; `buzzkit` stays lowercase only in package names, slugs, hostnames and code.
- Sentence case everywhere — buttons, headings, labels. **The widget is the one exception:** its titles and buttons are Title Case ("New Conversation", "Ask Us Anything"), which reads as product chrome on someone else's site rather than as that site's own copy. Descriptions stay sentences everywhere.
- Buttons start with a verb naming the action: "Save draft", "Delete project". Never "OK", never bare "Yes"/"No" on a consequential action.
- **Front-load the outcome and keep it short.** One line per description; if the title carries the meaning, drop the description entirely. Say what happens in plain words ("Sends the first message as that user"), not how it works.
- No jargon: product nouns like "publishable key" and "clientToken" stay; "idempotent", "payload", "envelope" never appear.
- Errors say how to recover, next to what broke: "Unable to reach the API. Check your connection and try again." No "Oops", no blame, no exclamation marks.
- **Promise liveness only where it is real.** "It appears here the moment it arrives" is a claim the socket must honor.
- Toggles are labeled for their ON state.
- Links describe their destination; never "click here" or a bare "Learn more".
- Empty states say what the place is and offer one next action.
- `text-balance` on titles, `text-pretty` on every description — no exceptions.

### One job per string

Each string does one job in full sentences, then stops. A page description says what the page is for ("Manage your workspace API keys.") and never adds a second sentence. A field hint says what the option is and where it is used. An empty state says how the first item gets there. None of them explain mechanics, reassure, sell or warn about things the reader did not ask about.

- Banned words: "successfully", "please", "just", "simply", "easily", "safe", "secure", "powerful", "seamless", "etc.", "e.g.", and telegraphic fragments joined by periods where a sentence belongs.
- Use the API's nouns and only those: workspace, tenant, subscriber, subscription, topic, channel, message, delivery, credential, key (never token), member, invite, webhook, source, segment, workflow, run, event. Providers are Apple and Android; the library is the SDK; the service is the API. The reader is "you"; the product is never "we".
- A user-given name inside copy goes in curly quotes (typographic “ ”, never straight): Revoke “Default”?, Delete “user_42”?
- Dialogs carry a title only; `AlertDialog` keeps its description — the consequence in one sentence, then "This cannot be undone." when it is irreversible, the second sentence on its own line (`<span className='block'>`).
- The header CTA and the dialog's submit button say the same words ("Create key" both places), and the destructive confirm repeats its consequence ("Revoke key", never "Confirm").
- A limit or count that resets on a clock names the clock: "The most messages a subscriber receives from this topic per day, counted in their own timezone." Never leave a reader guessing which midnight.
- Before shipping a string, read it as the person seeing it for the first time and ask whether Stripe would ship it word for word.

## 11. Accessibility contract

Non-negotiable, and verified on `/ui`:

- Every control has an accessible name; icon-only buttons take `aria-label`.
- Every field has a `<label for>`.
- Focus is `:focus-visible` with a visible ring. Never `outline-none` without a replacement — including read-only fields.
- Targets clear 24×24, extending with a pseudo-element rather than growing visually. Extended areas never overlap.
- Modals trap focus, close on Escape, and restore focus to the trigger.
- Toasts announce politely.
- Reduced motion is honored (§6).
- The layout reflows at 320px and 200% zoom with no horizontal scroll.
- Repeated navigation is preceded by a skip link.

---

## 12. Adding to the system

**A component:** `bunx shadcn add <name>` inside `packages/ui`, restyle to tokens, delete every color literal, apply the press pattern and the radius scale, then **add it to `/ui`** with every variant, size and state — including disabled and invalid.

**A token:** add the value to both `:root` and `.dark` in `globals.css`, map it under `@theme inline`, and document its role here. If a component needs a color no token covers, the missing thing is a token, not a hex.

**Never:** invent a size outside the type scale, borrow a token outside its role (`-4` as text, `fg-1` as text), or introduce a second styling approach.

---

## 13. Dashboard conventions

`apps/web` is Vite + React Router 8 (SSR) on Cloudflare Workers, deliberately **not** Next.js.

```
app/
  root.tsx                      Layout, providers, ErrorBoundary
  entry.server.tsx              Stock SSR entry
  cloudflare.ts                 `cloudflareContext`: env/ctx via RouterContextProvider
  routes.ts                     Route table
  lib/                          Server modules (`*.server.ts`: session cookie, API client, auth proxy)
                                and pure helpers (form, time, format)
  hooks/                        Client hooks (use-focus-first-error, use-time-ago)
  components/<feature>/         One directory per feature, presentational only, and only for pieces
                                two or more routes share: auth/ · badges/ · conditions/ · detail/ ·
                                errors/ · events/ · layout/ · messages/ · onboarding/ · segments/ ·
                                settings/ · sources/ · subscribers/ · webhooks/ · workflows/ · workspace/
  routes/<segment>/index.tsx    File-based routes, mirroring the API convention
  routes/[slug]/layout.tsx      Layout route for nested segments (brackets for dynamic parts)
```

**A component used by one route lives in that route file.** Nothing moves to `components/` speculatively; it earns the move when a second route needs it. Names are written out in full — no abbreviations, no `shell`-style vagueness, no prefixes; a file is named for what it is (`live-runs.tsx`, `spec-editor.tsx`). Route actions live in `lib/actions/<feature>.server.ts`, never in the route file — the route exports `export const action = …Action` and nothing else action-shaped.

**IDs in URLs are always bare.** Paths and query params carry the unprefixed sqid (via `bareId` in `lib/format.ts`); the API accepts both forms. The prefixed form (`msg_…`) is for display and copy actions only.

**No comments in apps/web.** The dashboard's code carries no comments; naming, small modules, and this document do the explaining. The only exceptions are `TEMPORARY` markers on code scheduled for deletion and lint directives.

**`routes/` is for routes; `components/<feature>/` is for the presentational modules they render.** Every feature owns a directory and splits along its seams, one module per surface: `onboarding/` keeps the shell, the progress stepper, the choice cards, the guide engine, and one file per provider guide apart. Feature components are plain components (no loaders, no route entries) so they stay previewable and restylable; route files own loaders/actions and error mapping. Anything reusable beyond this app belongs in `@buzzkit/ui` instead (`LivePing`, `CodeBlock`).

### Page anatomy

Every page opens the same way: the title over its one-line purpose (the standard title/description pair, 2px apart), and at most one page-level control at the header's opposite edge — the time range, or the page's single primary action. Below, sections stack in the page rhythm, each on a card. A detail page leads with the entity's identity — name, then its state and vocabulary badges — before any data. Nothing about a page's opening should need design decisions; the decisions are made here.

**Everything that names an entity takes you to it.** A workflow named in a run, a subscriber on a delivery, a segment on a message — a reference is a link, always. Plain text naming something that has a page is a dead end the reader has to route around, and a bug.

**Structure must earn its headings.** A navigation section with one item is not a section; fold it into a neighbor until it has company. The same instinct applies everywhere: numbering, group labels and dividers exist to encode real structure, never to decorate.

### Small screens

The dashboard is designed at desktop width and folds down, never the other way: no page has a mobile variant, a hidden column or a second component tree. Two breakpoints carry everything. **`lg` (1024px) is the chrome line**: below it the sidebar becomes a sheet behind a bar and the page scrolls as one document inside the panel (`docs/dashboard.md`, Layout). **`sm` (640px) is the row line**: below it anything laid out as "text on the left, control on the right" stacks instead, top to bottom in reading order.

- **Headers stack.** `PageHeader` and the hand-rolled detail headers are `flex-col items-start gap-3` under `sm` and `flex-row items-center justify-between` above; the action slot is a `flex gap-2` row that is full-width on a phone and shrink-wrapped on desktop, so a button keeps its size and a lookup field (`w-full sm:w-64`) fills the line.
- **Card headers wrap.** Above `sm` a `CardAction` is absolute, vertically centered at the right edge with `pr-28` reserved. Under `sm` the header is a `flex-wrap` row: the title takes its content width (`flex-auto`), a short action sits beside it on the same line, a wide one (a tab strip, a filter bar) wraps under it, and the description always lands last on its own line. An action wider than the card scrolls sideways inside its slot (`overflow-x-auto`) rather than wrapping, because `PillTabs` draws its pill with a single-line clip.
- **Filter bars stack.** `FilterBar` is `flex-col` under `sm`: the facets wrap in their own row, the search (`w-full sm:w-64`) takes the next line. A filter bar inside a `CardAction` passes `flex-row items-center` to stay a row. `FilterRange` shows one calendar month under 768px and two above.
- **A filter strip scrolls itself, and nothing else.** `PillTabs` owns a horizontal scroller with a `ScrollFade` around its row, so a strip too wide for its card scrolls inside its own box and fades at the edge instead of pushing the card wider — which is what used to drag a card's whole body sideways, empty state and all. `CardAction` carries the same fade for action content that is not pills (a chart legend, a row of badges) and is `min-w-0` so it can shrink: without that a flex item's automatic minimum keeps it at content width and `max-w-full` never bites.
- **Tables scroll, and never fix their layout on a phone.** Every table sits in the `Table` viewport (`overflow-auto`) and its cells are `whitespace-nowrap`, so a wide table scrolls sideways inside its card. `table-fixed` is a desktop nicety: `Table` adds `max-lg:table-auto` (the two raw attempt ledgers carry it by hand), because a fixed table whose sized columns exceed the card gives its unsized column zero width and the header text of one column paints over the next.
- **Rows that hold controls wrap.** A `SettingsRow` and a segment-builder condition row are `flex-wrap`, and a row's `end` slot that holds several inputs wraps too (the quiet-hours window); a fixed-width control inside gets a phone width (`w-40 sm:w-48`). Label columns in definition lists (`DetailRow` and its siblings) are `w-28 sm:w-36`.
- **Tiles pair up.** The Overview and event-detail tiles are `grid-cols-2` on a phone (`gap-3 sm:gap-5`) rather than a column of six; a tile's number row wraps its delta under the number when the two cannot share the line.
- **Banners stack.** A card that is a sentence with a button (no channel connected, messages scheduled, an unverified source) is `flex-col items-start` under `sm` and a row above, the button `shrink-0`.
- **Dialogs, sheets and menus already fit**: `DialogContent` caps at `calc(100% - 2rem)`, sheets take a fraction of the viewport, menus are 240px. Nothing sets a `w-*` wider than a phone without a `sm:` partner, and nothing reads the viewport in JavaScript except `useIsMobile` inside the design system (the responsive drawer, the range calendar).

### Settings are a family

Every settings surface reads as one household, built on the same card grammar: the card states what the setting is in its title and one sentence, the change happens in the body, and the footer carries the consequence in a quiet sentence beside one small action that just says **"Save"** (a destructive card says its verb instead). The mindset:

- **Saving is only possible when there is something to save.** The action stays disabled while the form matches what was loaded, while anything is invalid, and while a save is in flight. A button that is always pressable teaches the user it means nothing.
- **Invalid input is prevented, not scolded.** Fields validate as they are touched — the invalid ring appears immediately and gates the save — and where the format allows it, wrong input is impossible to type at all: a count field simply does not accept a minus sign. Rejection on submit is the last resort, not the plan.
- **Consequences are stated where they are decided**, in the footer sentence, in the setting's own terms — including which clock a daily limit counts against.
- **One concept, one control.** A value the product lets you pick somewhere (a timezone, a scope, a range) is picked with the same control, the same option order and the same defaults everywhere it appears. Two pickers for one concept means one of them is wrong.

### Vocabulary is owned once

Domain values — statuses, kinds, platforms, conditions, step summaries — are words and colors the whole product must say identically, so each vocabulary has exactly one home that turns the domain object into its label, color and sentence, and every page composes from it. Nobody re-derives a label, re-picks a status color, or hand-builds a rendering a vocabulary already owns; when a page needs a value the vocabulary lacks, the vocabulary grows first. This is why a platform badge, a trigger sentence or a condition chip is identical on every screen without anyone remembering.

Two shapes recur when vocabularies render:

- **Facts are label/value rows, never prose.** Structured detail — on a detail page, an expanded table row, a card footer — lands as a definition list: quiet label, strong value, copyable where the value is an identifier. A paragraph that embeds four facts is four rows wearing a costume.
- **A card says one thing; its details live below.** A card representing a unit of behavior (a workflow step, a node) carries exactly one plain-language statement in its body — what it does — and every structured fact (conditions, caps, timezones, counts) in its footer rows. A body that piles up facts, or a footer that restates the body, has the split wrong.
- **Truncation reveals the text form.** When chips or lists truncate behind a count, hovering reveals the full set in the vocabulary's text form, recolored for the tooltip's inverted surface (§9) — never the light-surface chips themselves.

`ErrorBoundary` lives in `root.tsx` because the name is React Router's contract: the framework renders that exact export when a route throws or nothing matches. It contains no markup of its own; it maps the thrown value onto a page component, picking `NotFoundPage` for a 404 (nothing broke, so it gets calmer copy and a real link home), `NoAccessPage` for a 403, and `ErrorPage` for everything else.

Theming is the shadcn Vite recipe: a `ThemeProvider` with `light | dark | system`, persisted to `localStorage` under `buzzkit-ui-theme`, applied by toggling the class on `<html>`, with `useTheme()` for consumers. `system` keeps following the OS via a `matchMedia` listener rather than only reading it once. `<html>` carries `suppressHydrationWarning` because the class is written on the client.

There is no inline pre-paint script, which is the one cost of the plain-React approach on SSR: a visitor whose stored theme is dark sees one light frame before hydration.

### Loaders are the source of truth, and the dashboard never polls

1. **Route loaders are the single source of truth.** Components render loader data; no client-side entity caches. Mutations go through route actions (`useActionFetcher` / `useFetcher`) and React Router revalidates the active loaders afterwards.
2. **The browser never holds the API token.** Every `/v1/*` call happens server-side in a loader or action with the bearer token from the signed session cookie (`docs/dashboard.md`).
3. **No `setInterval` fetching anywhere.** Live claims in copy ("appears the moment…") are reserved for a future realtime seam; until then waiting states use the live dot only where a navigation or action will settle them.
4. **Waiting states show the live dot** (§6 Restraint); arrival swaps it for the state change itself, never a toast announcing what the screen already shows.

### The onboarding guides

The onboarding is a single centered `Card` under four thin progress lines (no step numbers, no labels), under an account row spanning the page (`Signed in as <email>` at the left edge, a ghost `Sign out` at the right, the email truncating rather than wrapping): `Card` anatomy throughout, choice rows with the press pattern (`::before` tint + `0.985` scale, never a shadow change), and the provider guide one sub-step at a time with `Back` / `Next` in the `CardFooter`. Sub-steps swap with the 0.3 bounce-0 spring inside a `SizeAnimator`; the progress fill moves on the 0.5 spring.

The provider guides (`components/onboarding/guides/*.tsx`) are **data**: an ordered list of sub-steps, each with a title, a one-line description, an optional outbound link, the field(s) it produces, and an `illustration` component. The guide engine (`provider-guide.tsx`) renders the current sub-step, validates its fields, and submits every field in one form.

Illustrations are laid out at a fixed design size (640×400) inside `Browser` and scaled to the frame with a transform, so they read as a thumbnail of the whole screen rather than a zoomed crop and nothing truncates. The scale is pure CSS (`scale(calc(100cqw / 640px))` inside an `@container` frame of the same 16:10 ratio), so the server-rendered page is already at its final size and there is no measure-then-resize shift on first paint. Likewise the ring skips its delayed entry on the very first paint after a page load, where it would only appear a second late; it animates in on every step change after that. They are built from `components/onboarding/illustration/` primitives only (`Browser`, `Sidebar`, `Page`, `MockButton`, `MockInput`, `MockCheckbox`, `MockRow`, `MockTabs`, `MockDialog`, `Spot`): a focused crop of the third-party dashboard, drawn in our tokens, with exactly one `Spot` ring marking the thing to click or copy. The ring is one 2px `sky-4` ring and nothing else: no offset, no inner hairline, no fill, sitting `-inset-1` outside the target (wider insets only when the target has no padding of its own), on the target's own radius. It arrives only once the step transition has landed and been read: 0.6s after mount it fades in while settling from 1.12 to 1 (0.4s spring, bounce 0); earlier than that the user is still processing the slide and would miss it. Every two seconds it pulses once, a soft halo swelling 10px outward and fading, so the eye finds it on a busy mock without the ring shouting the rest of the time; `MockRow highlight` is the same ring and pulse on a table row. `SpotRing` in `illustration/spot.tsx` is the only source of the ring, its entry and its pulse; `Spot` and `MockRow highlight` both render it. Structure and copy mirror the real product screens; neutrals and type are ours, and the third party's own accent is kept for its primary actions (`MockButton variant='accent'`: Apple and Firebase blue) so the next thing to press reads as it does in their UI. Never paste screenshots. Never clip inside a padding: the `Browser` box clips at its own border, the card clips at its edge, and nothing in between carries `overflow-hidden`, or borders and slide transitions get cut.
