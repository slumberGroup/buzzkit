# buzzkit Docs

Product and architecture documentation — the source of truth for what we're building. One topic per file.

- [overview.md](overview.md) — product vision, goals, scope, and design principles
- [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) — the phased build plan, tenancy model, and pending decisions
- [engine.md](engine.md) — the engagement engine: events, workflows, segments, scheduled sends — the stack (subscriber actors on Durable Objects, Cloudflare Workflows, Tinybird) and how it feels (real apps with and without buzzkit); phases E1 Events through E8 iOS SDK built, E9 Workflows III in build, E10 Experiments designed; [webhooks.md](webhooks.md) is the delivery engine, [experiments.md](experiments.md) the experimentation design
- [architecture.md](architecture.md) — runtime, API layers, APNs egress findings, testing, secrets
- [configuration.md](configuration.md) — every variable, secret and binding, what it is for, and what a self-hoster actually needs
- [authentication.md](authentication.md) — credentials, scopes, workspace addressing, isolation invariants
- [admin.md](admin.md) — spec: `user.admin`, full invisible access to every workspace for support (changes show to the workspace as "BuzzKit Support"), the `/v1/admin/*` routes and the dashboard's admin section
- [data-model.md](data-model.md) — schema conventions and tables per phase
- [design.md](design.md) — the design system: tokens, components, motion, writing, the dashboard conventions (served at `/design.md`)
- [dashboard.md](dashboard.md) — `apps/web`: auth architecture, route map, the onboarding flow, and the dashboard phase plan
- [marketing.md](marketing.md) — `apps/marketing`: the buzzkit.dev site, its structure, and the agent surface (llms.txt, markdown twins, well-known catalogs) that must stay in sync with copy changes
- [buzz.md](buzz.md) — Buzz, the agent notification app built on buzzkit: `apps/ping` (the API at ping.buzzkit.dev), the iOS app, the one-Live-Activity merge, the pairing credentials and the schema-versioning rules
- [api/conventions.md](api/conventions.md) — envelope, ids, verbs, lists, errors, idempotency, headers — the contract every endpoint follows
- api/ — one file per API resource: [health](api/health.md), [workspaces](api/workspaces.md), [tenants](api/tenants.md), [keys](api/keys.md), [credentials](api/credentials.md), [secrets](api/secrets.md), [audit](api/audit.md), [webhooks](api/webhooks.md), [sources](api/sources.md), [events](api/events.md), [segments](api/segments.md), [workflows](api/workflows.md), [subscribers](api/subscribers.md), [imports](api/imports.md), [topics](api/topics.md), [messages](api/messages.md), [stats](api/stats.md), [client](api/client.md)
